# bookbot
practice repository with boot.dev
BookBot is my first (real) git project

notes for self:
- add a .gitignore file so that github only grabs code, not any files you're reading and store those files in a folder so you can just type "foldername/" in the .gitignore
- split processes into smaller functions
(I have a bad habit of thinking of how to do it all in one section of code)
(which is fine sometimes but not for, like, larger projects)
- focus on building better coding habits
